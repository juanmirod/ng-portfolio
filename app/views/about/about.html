    <p>Development is my carrer and learning is my main hobby. Some interests come and go with the time and changes in life, but learning is something I will never stop doing.</p>

    <p>If you are a developer and want to read/discuss with a fellow dev, you can <a href="http://blog.juanmirodriguez.es">read my blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.es/juanmirod">follow me on twitter</a>. About the blog, I write mainly in Spanish and I try to update often to improve my writing skills and to ground some knowledges because when you have to explain something you learn more about it and you understand it better.</p>

    <p>Right now I am learning about Functional Programming and Unit testing in JavaScript, and how to apply this principles to React-Redux and also about Design Patterns in a broader sense while keeping an eye in Angular2. I also try to learn some French day by day thanks to Duolingo.</p>
